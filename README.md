# Acquisition_mask

SBG-TIR will acquire data over land and coastal regions at 60 m spatial sampling (at nadir). To reduce data volumes, thermal data over the open ocean will be binned to 960 m (at nadir) on-board. VNIR data will not be acquired over open ocean. The following kmz and image file show which areas are within the high-resolution (60 m) acquisition mask.
